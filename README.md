This is my old game engine. It was rewritten using c++. New version is avalible here: https://github.com/BitKovin/REngine_2.0

This version uses MonoGame for input, rendering and as one of two audio backends.
It uses Quake 1 .map file with combination of Trenchbroom exported .obj file as it's main map format.
