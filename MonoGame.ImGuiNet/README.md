# MonoGame.ImGuiNet
MonoGame.ImGuiNet is a superset of ImGuiNet with additional Components (gonna release the components soon) designed for MonoGame.

# Getting Started

To install, you'll need to set `MonoGame.ImGuiNet` as the project reference for your main `.sln` file.
An issue was opened regarding an issue with the nuget package, so I wanted to explain that the nuget package will be out-of-date.
And I also explained in the issue on how t oadd it as a project reference, https://github.com/Mezo-hx/MonoGame.ImGuiNet/issues/1
